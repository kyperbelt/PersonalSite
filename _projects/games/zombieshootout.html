    You came to chew gum and kill zombies and you are all out of gum. Zombie Shootout is a simple SHMUP where you go
    through missions killing zombie grunts and bosses trying to get the high score.

    I made this game for the #RemakeJam, a game jam where we had to work on a previously abandoned game and “remake” it.
    I chose to remake one of my earlier libgdx projects by re-using the codebase and adding some more mechanics and new
    graphics.

    There was a lot left undone and I might consider going back to finish this, but the likely scenario is that I will
    probably remake it from the ground up. A lot of the code is spaghetti by my current standards, and I’ve learned some
    things in the since then. Also, I intended to make it available in the play store but I only ever manage to make an
    apk which is only available on the Itch.io page.
