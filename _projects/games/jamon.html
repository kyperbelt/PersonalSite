  Jamon is a fast-paced game where the goal is to collect as much ham as possible while avoiding enemies. There is
  power-ups, score multipliers, character select, leaderboards, and achievements among other things. Work for this game
  started early 2018 for the first ever Jambon Jam. The initial prototype was made over the weekend of the game jam but
  I decided to continue the project past the jam and eventually release it to the Google Play Store.

  Over the course of the project I worked alone doing everything from programing, art and design. To make this I used my
  games framework (kyperbox) that is built on top of libgdx. I ended up learning how to implement various Google API’s
  including Play Services for leaderboards and achievements and Ad Mob.

  Although there is still a lot of features I want to add, after It was on the Play Store, I decided to consider the
  project finished so that I could move on to other projects.
