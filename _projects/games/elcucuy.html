<p>
    El Cucuy is a small 2D horror game where the mood and suspense are set by the ambient sound. The goal of the game is
    to collect pages in order to leave the nightmare mansion, all while conserving flashlight battery and avoiding the
    monster that lurks in the darkness.
</p>

    This game was made for the “My First Game” Game jam. Although this was not my first game, it would be my brother’s
    first game, so I encouraged him to join the jam. He did all the game art and gameplay design while I focused on
    creating an interface between Libgdx and Tiled. I learned that I could almost make Tiled a fully-fledged game
    editor. My work on this project inspired the later work I did on Kyperbox.

    If I ever decide to revisit this, I will definitely give the user interface a needed overhaul. I would also consider
    making a mobile port since I think this type of game would do well in a handheld with headphones on.
