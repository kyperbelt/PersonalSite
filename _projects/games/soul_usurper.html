    Soul Usurper is a rogue-lite game in the vain of Binding of Isaac. Levels are procedurally generated where the end goal
    is to find and defeat the “Level” boss. In order to reach the boss, you must traverse rooms, find keys, and reach the
    Boss room. The boss room location is randomized each time the level is instantiated.
</p>

<p>
    This game was made in late 2018 with <a href="http://strayvoltagegames.com/" target="_blank"> StrayVoltage Games </a>. It was made for the Github Game Off, a yearly month-long game
    jam hosted on itch.io by Github. At the time we were working on a separate long-term project when we decided to take a
    break and participate in the jam.
</p>

<p>
    I did work on some UI elements like “Health” (bottom-left) and “Soul Energy” (right). We used behavior trees that I
    designed and programmed for the enemy AI. I was also able to add some shader effects for things like the enemies taking
    damage, and the Health bar visuals. This is something that I previously was not very confident with, but through this
    project I learned how to utilize shaders.
</p>

<p>
    We used several different tools to make this game. <a href='https://github.com/kyperbelt/KyperBox' target='_blank'>Kyperbox</a>  (game framework) is built on top of Libgdx, which were both
    used on this project. Tiled was used to make the levels and load in assets and meta data. Like mentioned above I was
    able to use OpenGL shaders in order to add special effects to the game.
</p>

<p>
    Overall, for a month-long project, I was very pleased with what we were able to accomplish. The game is not complete by
    any means, but we managed to produce something like what we initially had in mind. Some things that I would have liked
    to do, had time allowed, is to add more levels and enemies in addition to different weapon types and effects.
