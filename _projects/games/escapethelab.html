<p>
    A physics-based puzzle game where you play a brain that can control two robots, one big and one small. The goal is to
    overcome obstacles by thinking of unique solutions in order to have both robots reach the levelâ€™s exit.

    This game was made for the first <a href="https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017" target="_blank">Github GameOff</a> that I ever participated in which took place November of 2017. This
    is also the jam where I connected with the Stray Voltage Games crew. I did a bit of the programming, but I mainly
    focused on the level design. I Tried to design the levels to have a scaling difficulty curve trying to apply several
    concepts I picked up from GDC talks on YouTube.

<p>
    <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/" target="_blank">Libgdx</a> was the framework we used to create this game which at the time was the framework I was most familiar with. I
    happened to find someone who was using it as well and decided to join their team. I think the game was great! There
    was an adequate amount of challenge and the levels progressively add mechanics in order to keep things interesting.
