    CastleBan is a Sokoban clone with a medieval castle setting. The goal of the game is to push the blocks until all
    the switches are covered, but with you must be careful not to push the blocks into a position where they can no
    longer be pushed.
</p>
<p>
    I made this in August 2017 for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2017" target="_blank">LowRezJam</a>. The
    jam rules limited the game to having a resolution of 64x64. All the game art is pixel art that fits inside 64x64
    pixels and then scaled up to fit a larger game window.
</p>
<p>
    This was the first time I dove into the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> game engine. I
    found it to be a very easy to use game engine with a lot of bells and whistles any aspiring game developer could
    hope to find. I coded the entire game using Godotâ€™s python like language GDScript. I made all the art using
    paint.net and with a grid plugin.
</p>
<p>
    I think usually I prefer to make games using a framework but learning to use Godot I managed to make a some-what
    complete game in under 2 weeks without any prior engine knowledge. That was a huge wake up call that using a higher
    level tool can bring a higher level of productivity that might be worth the perceived tradeoffs.
